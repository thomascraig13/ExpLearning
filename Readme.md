# EXAMPLE VERSION OF DYNAMIC GUI
- Visit https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter for documentation on customtkinter
- Create a virtual environment and install the libraries in the requirements.txt file
- All 'source' code is held in the src folder. Helps keep organized.
- The example files are to show you an example of what a GUI could look like, and how one can integrate with a webscraper. The most important part to not be changed in the main.py file as that is the framework to keep everything together.
